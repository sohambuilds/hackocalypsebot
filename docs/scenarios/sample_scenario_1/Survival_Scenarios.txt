24-Hour Event Sequence for Survivors Starting at Node A




---


Hour 0


Location: Node A (City Hall)


Event: Survivors arrive and establish initial camp.






---


Hour 3


Location: Node B (Central Hospital)


Event: Chemical Leak


A hazardous chemical spill occurs within the Central Hospital.


Impact: Main Street (A ↔ B) becomes contaminated and temporarily unusable.








---


Hour 6


Location: Node C (Fire Station)


Event: Zombie Outbreak


Zombies breach the Fire Station perimeter.


Impact: First Avenue (B ↔ C) is compromised and poses a threat.








---


Hour 9


Location: Node D (Subway Entrance)


Event: Anomaly Detection


Unexplained energy anomalies detected near the Subway Entrance.


Impact: Broadway Street (C ↔ D) experiences intermittent disruptions.








---


Hour 12


Location: Node H (Major Intersection 1)


Event: Resource Scarcity Alert


Reports indicate dwindling medical supplies at the School Gymnasium (Node F).


Impact: Pathway to Gymnasium (H ↔ F) sees increased congestion and potential hazards.








---


Hour 15


Location: Node J (Park Area)


Event: Zombie Migration


Zombie activity observed migrating towards the Park Area.


Impact: Road to Park Area (B ↔ J) becomes highly dangerous and heavily infested.








---


Hour 18


Location: Node M (Small Residential Block)


Event: Structural Collapse


Partial collapse of buildings in the Small Residential Block.


Impact: Lane to Residential Block (E ↔ M) is blocked, restricting movement between these nodes.








---


Hour 21


Location: Node N (Riverside Path)


Event: Chemical Contamination Spread


Chemical leak from Node B spreads towards the Riverside Pathway.


Impact: Riverside Pathway (M ↔ N) becomes hazardous, limiting safe traversal.








---


Hour 24


Location: Node K (Campsite)


Event: Anomaly Escalation


Energy anomalies at the Campsite intensify, causing unpredictable environmental effects.


Impact: Trail to Campsite (J ↔ K) and Path to Cliffside Lookout (K ↔ L) become unstable and unsafe.








---


Summary of Affected Connections Over 24 Hours


A ↔ B (Main Street): Contaminated at Hour 3.


B ↔ C (First Avenue): Compromised by zombies at Hour 6.


C ↔ D (Broadway Street): Disrupted by anomalies at Hour 9.


H ↔ F (Pathway to Gymnasium): Hazardous congestion at Hour 12.


B ↔ J (Road to Park Area): Infested with zombies at Hour 15.


E ↔ M (Lane to Residential Block): Blocked by structural collapse at Hour 18.


M ↔ N (Riverside Pathway): Hazardous due to chemical spread at Hour 21.


J ↔ K (Trail to Campsite) & K ↔ L (Path to Cliffside Lookout): Unstable due to anomaly escalation at Hour 24.






---


Special Attributes Impacted


Safe Zones Affected:


Node F (School Gymnasium): Increased resource scarcity at Hour 12.


Node G (Library Basement): Indirectly affected through pathway disruptions.




Obstacle:


Node O (Collapsed Bridge): Remains as a removed connection throughout.




High-Density Areas:


Nodes A, B, C, and surrounding intersections experience escalating threats and disruptions over time.
